# Tech-Blog

## Description

This project is a content management system-style blog site with login, signup, create post, edit post, delete post, and add comment functions.

This project was created to prove my understanding of full-stack web development.

This project works by using a Model-View-Controller paradigm as the folder structure, Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the Objectâ€“relational mapping, and express-session npm package for authentication.
